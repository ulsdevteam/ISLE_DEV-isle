COMPOUND is a sample from https://digital.grinnell.edu of two Islandora compound (islandora:compoundCModel) objects.

1. *Compound_01* is a historic letter consisting of an envelope and two manuscript pages.

2. *Compound_02* is part of a published study in computer science consisting of a 2-page PDF document and a .tar binary dataset.

The COMPOUND folder also includes a _Compound.twig_ metadata template file and corresponding _Compound.csv_ MODS metadata sample.  It should be possible to ingest all 7 parent and child records using these files as input to the Islandora Multi-Importer (IMI, https://github.com/mnylc/islandora_multi_importer).
